This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError.  The `calculate_average` function calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it doesn't handle the case where an empty list is provided, leading to a division by zero. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error by checking for an empty list before performing the calculation.
